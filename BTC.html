  Bitcoin (abbreviation: BTC; sign: â‚¿) is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.[7] Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.[11] The currency began use in 2009,[12] when its implementation was released as open-source software.
